# Python3

The Python 3.x programming language is code distancing due to posssible contact with CODEVID-19.

[Support Python 3.x in the code hospital](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Code-distancing/discussions/38)

## Doctors notes

[1] One of our best patients, very committed to code distancing.

[2] Takes everything 100% literally <!-- Like me !--> be exact with what you say.

[3] No snakes in the room, don't worry (people who are scared of reptiles/handling reptiles)

## Technical

The code hospital and CODEVID-19 are joke terms meant to raise awareness on the pandemic and encourage people to continue social distancing, wearing a mask, and being safe.

This program is a basic Python 3.x script modified to have every line 6 line breaks apart.
