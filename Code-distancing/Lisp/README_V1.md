[Support Lisp in the code hospital](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Code-distancing/discussions/50)

## Doctors notes

[1] Lisp doesn't have a lisp, despite the name

## Technical

The code hospital and CODEVID-19 are joke terms meant to raise awareness on the pandemic and encourage people to continue social distancing, wearing a mask, and being safe.

This program is a basic Lisp script modified to have every line 6 line breaks apart.
