# Go

**Not to be confused with Go! (2004 Francis McCabe language) this is the language from 2009 by Google**

The Go programming language is code distancing due to posssible contact with CODEVID-19.

## Doctors notes

[1] Commonly mistaken for Go! (2004 language by Francis McCabe)

[2] Look at the cute, evil little gopher though.

## Technical

The code hospital and CODEVID-19 are joke terms meant to raise awareness on the pandemic and encourage people to continue social distancing, wearing a mask, and being safe.

This program is a basic Go script modified to have every line 6 line breaks apart.
