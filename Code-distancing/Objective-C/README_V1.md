[Support Objective-C in the code hospital](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Code-distancing/discussions/45)

## Doctors notes

[1] Not to be confused with Objective-C++

[2] Will there ever be an Objective-C# or Objective-C* (?)

## Technical

The code hospital and CODEVID-19 are joke terms meant to raise awareness on the pandemic and encourage people to continue social distancing, wearing a mask, and being safe.

This program is a basic Objective-C script modified to have every line 6 line breaks apart.
