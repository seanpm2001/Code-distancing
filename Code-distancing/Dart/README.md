# Dart

The Dart programming language is code distancing due to posssible contact with CODEVID-19.

[Support Dart in the code hospital](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Code-distancing/discussions/61)

## Doctors notes

[1] Not an actual dart, stop bringing this patient to the recreational room!

## Technical

The code hospital and CODEVID-19 are joke terms meant to raise awareness on the pandemic and encourage people to continue social distancing, wearing a mask, and being safe.

This program is a basic Dart script modified to have every line 6 line breaks apart.
