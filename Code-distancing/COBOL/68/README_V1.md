[Support COBOL 68 in the code hospital](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Code-distancing/discussions/22)

## Doctors notes

[1] Doctors note: Patient is elderly and is at a higher risk of dying from CODEVID-19. COBOL 68s health is unpredictable, at times COBOL is very healthy, and at others, it is on life support. It is a rare condition called "government dependancy syndrome/if it ain't broke don't fix it disease"

## Technical

The code hospital and CODEVID-19 are joke terms meant to raise awareness on the pandemic and encourage people to continue social distancing, wearing a mask, and being safe.

This program is a basic COBOL 68 script modified to have every line 6 line breaks apart.
