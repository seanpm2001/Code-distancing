# YAML

The YAML programming language is code distancing due to posssible contact with CODEVID-19.

[Support YAML in the code hospital](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Code-distancing/discussions/24)

## Doctors notes

[1] Doctor name review

```
Doctor input: what is your name?
Patient input: YAML
Doctor input: What does it stand for?
Patient input: YAML Ain't Markup Language
Doctor input: But what does that stand for?
Patient input: YAML Ain't Markup Language

Doctor analysis: Patient doesn't know their name
Doctor 2 review: the other doctor is a fool!
```

[2] Despite the name, YAML hates Yams. Why do we even have Yams at a hospital?

## Technical

The code hospital and CODEVID-19 are joke terms meant to raise awareness on the pandemic and encourage people to continue social distancing, wearing a mask, and being safe.

This program is a basic YAML script modified to have every line 6 line breaks apart.
