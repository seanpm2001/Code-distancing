[Support Rust in the code hospital](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Code-distancing/discussions/33)

## Doctors notes

[1] Patient is named rust, but isn't very rusty, but incredibly fast and strong, and highly stable. Given a tetanus shot just in case.

## Technical

The code hospital and CODEVID-19 are joke terms meant to raise awareness on the pandemic and encourage people to continue social distancing, wearing a mask, and being safe.

This program is a basic Rust script modified to have every line 6 line breaks apart.
