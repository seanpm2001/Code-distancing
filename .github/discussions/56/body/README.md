# Help Go recover from Codevid-19

**Not to be confused with Go! (2004 Francis McCabe language) this is the language from 2009 by Google**

This discussion page is for supporting the Go programming language recover from CODEVID-19 at the international code hospital. Here, you can leave nice comments, chat, and more. Leave a like if you support the Go programming language, leave a dislike if you don't.

**Disclaimer: the code hospital and codevid-19 are joke concepts for this project and are not real. Computer programs cannot get infected with medical diseases, this theme is meant to be a joke that helps raise awareness for the bad times we are in.**
