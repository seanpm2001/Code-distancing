### Project: code distancing in all languages

A goal I have been working on for this project is to make code distancing script files in all programming languages (and later all common human-spoken languages)

This is similar to what http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code does.

This has been an ongoing project since October 4th 2020, but I am announcing it publicly today (October 7th 2020)
