## Code hospital

Starting with an update on February 28th 2021, I began making improvements to this project again. I categorized parts of it to have a running joke, where each programming language is in its own separate room at a code hospital. Inside each room, program scripts are showcasing how to code distance. New features that started being added today include support for image versions (if you want to see what it looks like in different environment) and a README file showcasing support info, some more jokes, and a link to a discussion where you can support the programming languages you like.

To get into the code hospital, you have to put on a mask first. You can go in without a mask, and infect everyone (this project currently isn't interactive, so you should just use your imagination for this)

Heavy disclaimer (unfortunately I actually need one of these, as some people might actually believe this project isn't fiction)

**Disclaimer: the code hospital and codevid-19 are joke concepts for this project and are not real. Computer programs cannot get infected with medical diseases, this theme is meant to be a joke that helps raise awareness for the bad times we are in.**
