Installing Seanpm2001/Code-distancing
---

Code distancing currently doesn't require installation (as of August 25th 2021) although it requires 2 programs/packages to be installed:

* HTML 5 or higher

* Python 3.0 or higher

HTML is needed for the website structure, while Python is needed for the project language file, along with many components. You will still need supporting packages to test the various languages used in this project.

Although, for this package, you can choose which languages you want to support and which ones you don't, down to the very version.

There is way too much to list here (ommitted 10000+ entries) just install the package related to the language you want to support.

For example, if you want to support PHP 7.3.2, install the PHP 7.3.2 package.

We trust you have experience with package installation to be reading this.

If you don't know how to do this, do some web searches through your preferred search engine(s)
