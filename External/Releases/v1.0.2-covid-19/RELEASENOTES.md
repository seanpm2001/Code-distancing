This program is a joke program, but it is also being used to raise awareness of how dangerous COVID-19 really is. Please keep yourself and others safe during this time by wearing a mask (that **COMPLETELY** covers your mouth, and nose) and social distancing (by staying at least 6 feet apart) we can get through this if we try. There is also a common belief that after you get vaccinated that you are invincible from COVID-19. **This is false.** Even 5 weeks after your 2nd COVID-19 vaccine, you should still wear a mask and socially distance until everyone around you is vaccinated. The vaccine isn't 100% effective, it is 95% effective. There is still that 5% chance of getting it, which increases when you become careless. The original 95% is an estimate as well. Please remember to continue with the regular guidelines even after vaccinating, and stay safe.
