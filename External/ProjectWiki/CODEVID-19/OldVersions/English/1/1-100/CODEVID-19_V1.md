# CODEVID-19

CODEVID-19 is the computer source code variant of COVID-19. It can be mitigated with the [CODEVID-19 developer vaccine](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Code-distancing/wiki/Vaccine-(feature)) but the main method of getting rid of it is by [code distancing](ttps://github.com/seanpm2001/Code-distancing/wiki/Code-distancing/) Luckily, code cannot die from CODEVID-19, but it can rot and become inefficient.
