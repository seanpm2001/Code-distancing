# Vaccine (feature)

_This article is about the CODEVID-19 vaccine. If you have not had your COVID-19 vaccine yet, please go get one. It is worth it_

The [CODEVID-19](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Code-distancing/wiki/CODEVID-19/) developer vaccine feature is a joke feature that sanitizes your code from [CODEVID-19](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Code-distancing/wiki/CODEVID-19/) and allowing it to grant immunity from the virus.

You can give your code the vaccine by [clicking/tapping here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Code-distancing/blob/main/Vaccine/GetDeveloperVaccine.md) just go through the form.
